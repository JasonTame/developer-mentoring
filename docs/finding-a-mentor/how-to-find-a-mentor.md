The [Mentor List](mentor-list) is a community-driven effort to connect those looking for mentorship with willing mentors. Mentors are able to submit a PR to add themselves to the list, and mentees are responsible for reaching out to a mentor that they feel is the best fit. Many of the mentors hang out in the [ZATech Slack #mentoring channel](https://zatech.co.za/).

Both mentors and mentees should read the guide to ensure they understand what the expectations are from both sides, before engaging in a mentoring relationship. Mentors kindly offer their time and are under no obligation to provide mentorship.
